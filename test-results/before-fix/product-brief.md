# Product Brief: API Gateway for Microservices

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Author:** Justin
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary
The API Gateway for Microservices project addresses critical security, performance, and integration challenges in our rapidly evolving microservices architecture. With 15+ services currently deployed, developers face fragmented authentication, no centralized rate limiting, complex routing configurations, and poor visibility into API performance. This centralized gateway will provide unified authentication/authorization, intelligent traffic management, dynamic service discovery, and comprehensive monitoring - reducing developer friction, improving security posture, and enabling our microservices platform to scale to 10,000+ requests per second while maintaining sub-200ms response times.

---

## Problem Statement
Our organization's transition to microservices has created several critical operational challenges:
**Security Vulnerabilities:**
- Each service implements its own authentication logic
- No centralized authorization enforcement
- Inconsistent security policies across services
- Difficult to audit access patterns
**Performance and Reliability Issues:**
- No protection against traffic spikes
- Services can be overwhelmed by requests
- No circuit breaker patterns implemented
- Manual intervention required for scaling
**Developer Friction:**
- Hard-coded service URLs in client applications
- Each client must adapt to different API formats
- No standardized error handling
- Complex integration requirements
**Operational Blindspots:**
- No centralized logging for API calls
- Distributed tracing is manual and incomplete
- Performance metrics scattered across services
- Difficult to diagnose cross-service issues

---

## Proposed Solution
A centralized API Gateway that sits between all clients and backend microservices, providing:
**Core Capabilities:**
- JWT token validation and OAuth 2.0 support
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting per user and per endpoint
- Dynamic service discovery and routing
- Request/response transformation
- Protocol translation (REST to gRPC)
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Centralized logging and metrics collection
**Implementation Approach:**
```bash
# Gateway deployment
npm install @company/api-gateway
./gateway config add-service user-service http://users:3001
./gateway config add-service order-service http://orders:3002
./gateway start --port 8080
```

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
**Runtime:**
```yaml
node_version: "20.x"
memory: "2GB minimum"
cpu: "2 cores minimum"
storage: "20GB for logs and metrics"
```
**Dependencies:**
- Node.js 20+ runtime
- Redis for session management
- PostgreSQL for configuration storage
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Kubernetes 1.25+ for orchestration

### Technology Preferences
**Gateway Implementation:**
- Node.js for core runtime (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Express.js or Fastify for HTTP handling
- JWT library for token validation
- Rate limiting: ioredis + sliding window algorithm
**Monitoring Stack:**
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

2. **Configuration as Code** - All routing rules in version-controlled YAML files
3. **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible middleware system for custom logic
4. **Graceful Degradation** - Continue routing even if monitoring/logging fails
5. **Zero-downtime Deploys** - Rolling updates with health checks

## Risks and Open Questions

### Key Risks
1. **Single Point of Failure**
*Mitigation:* Deploy multiple gateway instances with load balancer
2. **Performance Bottleneck**

3. **Security Vulnerability**
*Mitigation:* Regular security audits, penetration testing, bug bounty program
4. **Integration Complexity**
*Mitigation:* Comprehensive testing with each service before rollout

### Open Questions
- Should we build custom or adopt existing solution (Kong, AWS API Gateway)?
- How do we handle legacy services with custom auth mechanisms?
- What's the migration strategy for existing client applications?
- How do we manage gateway configuration across environments?

### Areas Needing Further Research
