**Author:** Justin
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Project Level:** 3
**Target Scale:** Enterprise

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
1. Centralize authentication and authorization for all microservices
2. Implement intelligent traffic management with rate limiting and throttling
3. Provide dynamic service discovery and routing capabilities
4. Enable comprehensive monitoring and observability across all APIs
5. Reduce developer onboarding time from 2 days to 4 hours
6. Achieve sub-200ms API response times at 10,000 req/s throughput

### Background Context
Our organization has rapidly adopted microservices architecture, growing from 3 services to 15+ services in 12 months. This growth has exposed critical gaps in our platform:
**Current Pain Points:**
- Each service implements its own authentication (security risk)
- No centralized rate limiting or traffic management
- Hard-coded service URLs in client applications
- No unified logging or monitoring for API calls
- Developer friction during service integration
**Business Impact:**
- 2+ days required for new developer onboarding
- Security vulnerabilities from inconsistent auth implementations
- Poor scalability under traffic spikes
- Difficult incident diagnosis and resolution
**Strategic Context:**
This API Gateway is foundational for our Q1 2025 initiative to "Accelerate microservices adoption" and Q2 2025 goal to achieve 99.9% platform reliability. It enables our transition to a full service mesh architecture and supports our security roadmap toward zero-trust by 2026.

## User Journeys

**Journey 1: Backend Developer Integrating a New Service**
**Actor:** Backend Developer (Sarah)
**Goal:** Integrate new user-profile-service with existing API ecosystem
**Steps:**
1. Sarah deploys user-profile-service to Kubernetes cluster
2. Service exposes /health endpoint for health checks
3. Sarah creates routing configuration file:
```yaml
service:
  name: user-profile-service
  routes:
    - path: /api/v1/profiles/*
      methods: [GET, POST, PUT, DELETE]
  health_check:
    endpoint: /health
    interval: 30s
```
4. Sarah applies configuration: `kubectl apply -f user-profile-routes.yaml`
5. Gateway automatically discovers service via Kubernetes DNS
6. Sarah tests endpoint: `curl https://gateway.company.com/api/v1/profiles/123`
7. Request is authenticated, routed, and logged automatically
**Success Criteria:**
- Integration completed in < 1 hour
- Zero authentication code written in service
- Full observability from day one
**Journey 2: DevOps Engineer Responding to Traffic Spike**
**Actor:** DevOps Engineer (Mike)
**Goal:** Protect backend services during unexpected traffic surge
**Steps:**
1. Mike receives alert: "Order service CPU at 90%"
2. Opens gateway analytics dashboard
3. Sees traffic spike on /api/v1/orders endpoint (5x normal)
4. Updates rate limit configuration:
```yaml
rate_limits:
  - endpoint: /api/v1/orders/*
    limit: 100
    window: 1m
    scope: ip
```
5. Applies configuration change (takes effect in < 10 seconds)
6. Gateway begins throttling excessive requests
7. Order service CPU drops to 40%
8. Mike investigates source of traffic spike
**Success Criteria:**
- Incident mitigated in < 5 minutes
- No backend service crashes
- Legitimate traffic continues flowing
**Journey 3: External Partner Accessing Public APIs**
**Actor:** External Developer (Acme Corp integration)
**Goal:** Call company APIs to fetch user data
**Steps:**
1. External developer obtains OAuth 2.0 credentials
2. Requests access token:
```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.company.com/oauth/token \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  -d 'client_id=acme_corp' \
  -d 'client_secret=secret123'
```
3. Receives JWT access token (expires in 1 hour)
4. Calls API with token:
```bash
curl https://gateway.company.com/api/v1/users/123 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```
5. Gateway validates token and forwards to user-service
6. Response returned with appropriate CORS headers
**Success Criteria:**
- OAuth flow completes successfully
- API calls authenticated and authorized
- Rate limits enforced per partner

## UX Design Principles
While the API Gateway is primarily a backend system, its configuration interface and analytics dashboard must follow these principles:
**1. Configuration as Code First**
All routing rules, rate limits, and policies defined in version-controlled YAML files. No manual UI-based configuration that creates drift.
**2. Fail Fast with Clear Errors**
Invalid configurations rejected immediately with specific error messages pointing to the problem line/field.
**3. Observable by Default**
Every request logged with full context. Metrics exported automatically. No "dark corners" where behavior is invisible.
**4. Progressive Complexity**
Simple use cases (basic routing) require minimal configuration. Advanced features (circuit breakers, transformations) opt-in via additional config.
**5. Self-Service for Developers**
Service teams can add routing rules via pull requests. No dependency on gateway team for standard integrations.

## User Interface Design Goals
**Analytics Dashboard (Grafana)**
**Primary Goals:**
- Real-time visibility into API traffic patterns
- Quick identification of performance anomalies
- Historical trend analysis for capacity planning
**Key Metrics Displayed:**
| Metric | Visualization | Update Frequency |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Requests per second | Line chart | 5 seconds |
| Response time (p50, p95, p99) | Line chart | 5 seconds |
| Error rate by endpoint | Bar chart | 10 seconds |
| Rate limit violations | Counter | Real-time |
| Backend service health | Status grid | 30 seconds |
| Top endpoints by traffic | Table | 1 minute |
**Configuration Interface (YAML + Git)**
Developers interact with gateway through YAML configuration files in Git repository:
Example routing configuration:
```yaml
# config/services/user-service.yaml
service:
  name: user-service
  upstream: http://user-service:3000
  routes:
    - path: /api/v1/users
      methods: [GET, POST]
      auth: required
      rate_limit: standard
    - path: /api/v1/users/:id
      methods: [GET, PUT, DELETE]
      auth: required
      rate_limit: standard
  health_check:
    path: /health
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 5s
```
**Design Goals:**
- Self-documenting configuration with inline comments
- Validation on commit via CI/CD pipeline
- Changes applied automatically after merge to main
