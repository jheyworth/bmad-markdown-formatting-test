# API Gateway for Microservices - Epic Breakdown

**Author:** Justin
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## Epic 1: Core Gateway Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish foundational gateway runtime with basic routing capabilities

**Business Value:** Enables all subsequent features by providing the core platform for request handling and routing

**Dependencies:** None - this is the foundation

**Estimated Effort:** 3 weeks (2 engineers)

### Stories

#### Story 1.1: Gateway Server Setup

**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** a production-ready HTTP server with health endpoints
**So that** we have a reliable foundation for the gateway

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Server starts on configurable port (default 8080)
- Health endpoint at /health returns 200 OK with status JSON
- Readiness endpoint at /ready checks downstream dependencies
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM (drain connections, max 30s)
- Request timeout configurable (default 30s)
- Support for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

**Technical Notes:**

```javascript
// server.js
const server = app.listen(config.port, () => {
  console.log(`Gateway listening on port ${config.port}`);
});

process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  server.close(() => process.exit(0));
});
```

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for server lifecycle
- Integration tests for health endpoints
- Load tests confirming 10,000 req/s capacity

#### Story 1.2: Path-Based Routing Engine

**As a** backend developer
**I want** requests routed to services based on URL path patterns
**So that** clients can access any service through a single gateway URL

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Support exact path matching (e.g., /api/v1/users)
- Support wildcard path matching (e.g., /api/v1/users/*)
- Support path parameters (e.g., /api/v1/users/:id)
- Return 404 for unmatched routes
- Route priority: exact > param > wildcard
- Log routing decisions for debugging

**Configuration Example:**

```yaml
routes:
  - path: /api/v1/users
    service: user-service
    methods: [GET, POST]
  - path: /api/v1/users/:id
    service: user-service
    methods: [GET, PUT, DELETE]
```

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for routing logic
- Integration tests with mock services
- Performance tests for routing overhead

#### Story 1.3: Configuration Loading System

**As a** platform engineer
**I want** gateway configuration loaded from YAML files
**So that** routing rules are version-controlled and auditable

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Load configuration from config/ directory on startup
- Validate configuration schema before applying
- Return clear error messages for invalid config
- Support configuration reload without restart (SIGHUP)
- Merge multiple YAML files (one per service)
- Environment variable substitution in config

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for YAML parsing
- Validation tests for schema enforcement
- Integration tests for hot reload

## Epic 2: Authentication & Authorization

**Goal:** Add comprehensive auth capabilities supporting multiple methods

**Business Value:** Centralizes security, reduces implementation burden on service teams, improves compliance posture

**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (routing must work first)

**Estimated Effort:** 4 weeks (2 engineers)

### Stories

#### Story 2.1: JWT Token Validation

**As a** backend service
**I want** JWT tokens validated before requests reach me
**So that** I can trust the user identity in the request

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Validate JWT signature using configured public key
- Check token expiration (exp claim)
- Check token not-before (nbf claim)
- Extract user ID and roles from token claims
- Add user context to request headers (X-User-ID, X-User-Roles)
- Return 401 Unauthorized for invalid tokens
- Support both RS256 and HS256 algorithms

**Token Format:**

```json
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "roles": ["user", "admin"],
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "iat": 1234567800
}
```

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for token validation logic
- Integration tests with real JWT tokens
- Security tests for common attacks (expired, tampered)

#### Story 2.2: OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow

**As an** external API consumer
**I want** to obtain access tokens via OAuth 2.0
**So that** I can securely call APIs without user interaction

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Implement POST /oauth/token endpoint
- Support grant_type=client_credentials
- Validate client_id and client_secret
- Issue JWT access tokens (expires in 1 hour)
- Support token refresh (optional)
- Rate limit token endpoint (10 req/min per client)

**Request/Response:**

```bash
# Request
POST /oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=acme&client_secret=secret

# Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

**Testing:**

- Integration tests for full OAuth flow
- Security tests for credential validation
- Rate limiting tests

## Epic 3: Traffic Management

**Goal:** Protect backend services with intelligent traffic control

**Business Value:** Prevents service outages from traffic spikes, improves reliability, enables safe scaling

**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (routing), Epic 2 (auth for per-user limiting)

**Estimated Effort:** 3 weeks (2 engineers)

### Stories

#### Story 3.1: Sliding Window Rate Limiting

**As a** platform engineer
**I want** configurable rate limits per user/endpoint/IP
**So that** no single client can overwhelm backend services

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Support per-user rate limiting (requires auth)
- Support per-endpoint rate limiting
- Support per-IP rate limiting
- Use sliding window algorithm (not fixed window)
- Return HTTP 429 with Retry-After header
- Store counters in Redis for multi-instance support

**Configuration:**

```yaml
rate_limits:
  - endpoint: /api/v1/search
    limit: 100
    window: 60s
    scope: user
  - endpoint: /api/v1/*
    limit: 1000
    window: 60s
    scope: ip
```

**Response Headers:**

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 42
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1234567890
Retry-After: 30
```

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for rate limit algorithm
- Integration tests with Redis
- Load tests confirming limits enforced

#### Story 3.2: Circuit Breaker Pattern

**As a** platform engineer
**I want** automatic circuit breaking for failing services
**So that** cascading failures are prevented

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Monitor error rate per backend service
- Open circuit after 50% error rate in 1-minute window
- Return 503 Service Unavailable when circuit open
- Half-open circuit after 30 seconds to test recovery
- Close circuit if health check succeeds
- Configurable thresholds per service

**Testing:**

- Integration tests simulating service failures
- Tests for circuit state transitions
- Tests for recovery after circuit opens

## Epic 4: Observability & Operations

**Goal:** Provide comprehensive monitoring and operational tooling

**Business Value:** Enables rapid incident response, capacity planning, and performance optimization

**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (core infrastructure)

**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks (1 engineer + 1 DevOps)

### Stories

#### Story 4.1: Prometheus Metrics Export

**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** gateway metrics exported to Prometheus
**So that** I can monitor performance and set up alerts

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Track request count by method, path, status code
- Track request duration histogram (p50, p95, p99)
- Track rate limit violations counter
- Track circuit breaker state gauge
- Update metrics in real-time (<1s lag)

**Metrics Example:**

```
# TYPE gateway_requests_total counter
gateway_requests_total{method="GET",path="/api/v1/users",status="200"} 1523

# TYPE gateway_request_duration_seconds histogram
gateway_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.05"} 1200

- Dashboard shows p50/p95/p99 latency line charts
- Dashboard shows error rate by endpoint bar chart
- Dashboard shows rate limit violations counter
- Dashboard shows top 10 endpoints by traffic
- Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds

**Dashboard Panels:**
