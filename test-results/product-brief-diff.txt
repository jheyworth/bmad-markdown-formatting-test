 ## Executive Summary
+
 The API Gateway for Microservices project addresses critical security, performance, and integration challenges in our rapidly evolving microservices architecture. With 15+ services currently deployed, developers face fragmented authentication, no centralized rate limiting, complex routing configurations, and poor visibility into API performance. This centralized gateway will provide unified authentication/authorization, intelligent traffic management, dynamic service discovery, and comprehensive monitoring - reducing developer friction, improving security posture, and enabling our microservices platform to scale to 10,000+ requests per second while maintaining sub-200ms response times.

 ## Problem Statement
+
 Our organization's transition to microservices has created several critical operational challenges:
+
 **Security Vulnerabilities:**
+
 - Each service implements its own authentication logic
 - No centralized authorization enforcement
 - Inconsistent security policies across services
 - Difficult to audit access patterns
+
 **Performance and Reliability Issues:**
+
 - No protection against traffic spikes
 - Services can be overwhelmed by requests
 - No circuit breaker patterns implemented
 - Manual intervention required for scaling
+
 **Developer Friction:**
+
 - Hard-coded service URLs in client applications
 - Each client must adapt to different API formats
 - No standardized error handling
 - Complex integration requirements
+
 **Operational Blindspots:**
+
 - No centralized logging for API calls
 - Distributed tracing is manual and incomplete
 - Performance metrics scattered across services
