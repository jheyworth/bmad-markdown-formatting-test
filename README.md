# BMAD Markdown Formatting Test

**Test Repository for BMAD v6 Markdown Formatting Fix**

This repository demonstrates the markdown formatting fix for BMAD v6-alpha, showing before/after comparison of BMAD-generated documentation with proper GitHub rendering.

---

## üéØ Purpose

Validate that the 6 markdown formatting rules correctly resolve rendering issues in BMAD-generated documentation when viewed on GitHub.

---

## üìä Test Scenario

**Project:** API Gateway for Microservices

A comprehensive project that naturally exercises all markdown formatting patterns:

- Bullet lists (acceptance criteria, features, pain points)
- Numbered lists (steps, phases, priorities)
- Tables (metrics, configurations, dashboard panels)
- Code blocks (bash, yaml, json, javascript)
- Mixed content (nested lists, code in journeys, tables in requirements)

## üîç The Problem

BMAD-generated markdown documentation doesn't render properly in GitHub due to missing blank lines around lists, tables, and code blocks.

### Issues Found (Before Fix)

**Example 1: Lists Render as Plain Text**

Without a blank line after the bold header, bullets don't render as a list:

```markdown
**Security Vulnerabilities:**
- Each service implements its own authentication logic
- No centralized authorization enforcement
- Inconsistent security policies across services
```

**GitHub Rendering:** All bullets flow together as a single paragraph of plain text, not a formatted list.

**Why:** GitHub's markdown parser requires a blank line between a text element and a list to recognize the list formatting.

**Example 2: Tables Don't Format**

```markdown
**Performance Metrics:**
| Metric | Current | Target |
```

GitHub renders this as plain text, not a table.

**Example 3: Code Blocks Lack Context**

Code blocks without blank lines before/after lose visual separation and proper rendering.

### How the Fix Resolves This

**After Fix - Proper Blank Lines:**

```markdown
**Security Vulnerabilities:**

- Each service implements its own authentication logic
- No centralized authorization enforcement
- Inconsistent security policies across services
```

**GitHub Rendering:** Bullets now render as a properly formatted list with visual bullets and proper indentation.

**The Difference:** One blank line (line 20 in the fixed version) makes the difference between broken and perfect rendering.

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

Add 6 markdown formatting rules to `bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml` in the `<template-output>` section:

1. **ALWAYS add blank line before and after bullet lists** (-, *, +)
2. **ALWAYS add blank line before and after numbered lists** (1., 2., etc.)
3. **ALWAYS add blank line before and after tables** (| header |)
4. **ALWAYS add blank line before and after code blocks** (```)
5. **Use - for bullets consistently** (not * or +)
6. **Use language identifier for code fences** (```bash, ```javascript, etc.)

## üî¨ Test Methodology

### Environment

- **OS:** macOS (zsh)
- **BMAD Version:** v6.0.0-alpha.0 (branch: v6-alpha)
- **Test Type:** Fresh install end-to-end
- **Workflows:** Analyst (product-brief) + PM (PRD + epics)

### Phase 1: Baseline (Before Fix)

1. Fresh BMAD installation WITHOUT markdown formatting fix
2. Generated product-brief.md, PRD.md, and epics.md
3. Committed to GitHub (commit `dcf405f`)

### Phase 2: With Fix

2. Deleted generated docs
3. Regenerated with identical content
4. Committed to GitHub (commit `0b30d47`)

### Phase 3: Validation

1. Compared commits in GitHub
2. Verified visual rendering improvements
3. Analyzed diffs (1112 lines of formatting changes)
4. Documented findings in `test-results/FINDINGS.md`

## üé® Visual Comparison

### Before Fix - Lists as Plain Text

Visit [product-brief.md at dcf405f](https://github.com/jheyworth/bmad-markdown-formatting-test/blob/dcf405f/docs/product-brief.md#problem-statement) and observe:

**Specific Example (Lines 16-20 in before-fix):**
```
Line 16: **Security Vulnerabilities:**
Line 17: - Each service implements its own authentication logic
         ‚Üë NO BLANK LINE - bullets render as plain text!
```

**What You'll See in GitHub:**
- "Security Vulnerabilities:" followed by plain text instead of bullet list
- "Performance and Reliability Issues:" bullets also flow together
- "Developer Friction:" bullets not rendering properly
- Tables appear as plain text

### After Fix - Proper Rendering

Visit [product-brief.md at 0b30d47](https://github.com/jheyworth/bmad-markdown-formatting-test/blob/0b30d47/docs/product-brief.md#problem-statement) and observe:

**Specific Example (Lines 19-21 in after-fix):**
```
Line 19: **Security Vulnerabilities:**
Line 20:
Line 21: - Each service implements its own authentication logic
         ‚Üë BLANK LINE ADDED - bullets now render properly!
```

**What You'll See in GitHub:**
- All bullet lists render with proper formatting and visual bullets
- Tables display with borders and alignment
- Code blocks have proper spacing and syntax highlighting
- Professional, publication-ready appearance

**Recommendation:** Open both versions side-by-side in separate browser tabs to see the dramatic difference. Pay special attention to the "Problem Statement" section.
